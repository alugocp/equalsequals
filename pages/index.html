			<table><tr>
				<td>
					<img class="icon" src="images/laptop.svg"><br>
					Equals Equals is a new kind of hackathon meant to introduce and expose underrepresented minorities to careers in technology and technology entrepreneurship. It's kind of like a design sprint and a hackathon had a baby, and it's name was Equals Equals.
				</td><td>
					<img class="icon" src="images/send.svg"><br>
					Community and inclusion breeds innovation, excitement, and motivation to solve some pretty tough problems.
				</td><td>
					<img class="icon" src="images/public.svg"><br>
					Our hope is that this event will not only get underrepresented groups excited about technology and it's capabilities, but also about the impact it can have on the issues and communities that they are most passionate about.
